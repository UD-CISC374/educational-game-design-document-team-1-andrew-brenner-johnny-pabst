## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*


Travel the world region to region battling different country’s most pressing environmental issues. Lay your defenses down in order to protect the environment against the enemy in this tower defense style strategy game. 

## Influences (Brief)

- Plants vs. Zombies:
  - Medium: Video Game
  - Explanation: Our core battle mechanic is heavily influenced by the Plants vs. Zombies' tower defense style
- Pokemon/Final Fantasy:
  - Medium: Video Game
  - Explanation: Our overworld and transition to battle scenes is based on the classic RPG mechanics found in games like Pokemon and Final Fantasy. Our stats page is inspired by Pokemon’s Pokedex mechanic. 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

Scene 1 Mechanics (Overworld)
- Move up/down/left/right on map
- Collide into country badges to initiate battles
- Open menu with ‘P’ key

Overworld Menu
Use arrows to move up and down list of countries

Scene 2 Mechanics (Battle Scene)
-  Use num pad to select available environment resource
- use arrow keys to move on grid-layout
-  space bar to place on grid-layout
- enemy moves right to left on plane
- enemy collides with left-hand boundary object → overall health is damaged
- Enemy collides with “tower” -> damages tower health
- User plant/tower attacks enemy -> enemy takes damage (various types of plants with different attacks, ranges)



# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*
Deforestation
Conservation policy
Geography
Clean energy

## Target Audiences

*Who are your learners?*
5th through 8th grade

## Target Contexts

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*
During environmental science units in middle school science courses

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- Country Primary Issues: Name countries and their primary environmental issues (i.e. deforestation, pollution, forest fires)
- Methods Against issues: List ways that countries are combating environmental issues
- Country Severity : Compare severity of environmental issues between countries

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*
n/a
- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #1*
- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #2*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*
Pre/post test
Example questions: 
Which of the following methods is most effective against air pollution?
Match countries to their corresponding environmental issue
Rank countries by air pollution severity

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- The lessons are inherent in the gameplay mechanics. These learning objectives will be achieved by in-game visual and gameplay cues rather than simply reading informational pieces.
- Player’s can get a sense of accomplishment from combating environmental issues
- Learning objects will inform the user on methods of dealing with current environmental issues
- The player obtains a sense of progress by defeating pressing issues and cleaning up the earth. The player will visibly see on the map that each region is becoming healthier as they progress.
- *etc.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

*Describe how people play your game, how many players are involved at once, how they interact with the system works, etc.*
This is a game for one person, they control the player in the overworld region to region with the arrow keys. When battles are initiated they use and place Towers with the number pad, arrow keys, and spacebar. Defend the area and defeat the enemy. Continue conquering the overworld through battles until every issue is resolved.

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

-Title Screen: Title with start button which initiates the tutorial
- Tutorial Mode: Player is dropped into the overworld area with pop-up messages teaching the player how to move and interact with the world. There is then a transition to a tutorial battle sequence which explains the battle mechanics. The player is then free to roam the overworld freely.
- Overworld: World map with overlay badges corresponding to a country’s particular environmental issue. Player may initiate a battle scene when colliding with a badge pinned on the map.
- Overworld Menu: Can only be accessed in the overworld. 
	- Stats Pages: Displays a general progress bar and a list of all in-game countries.
		- A country can be in one of three modes: locked, unresolved, and resolved.
			- locked countries will display required progress needed to battle
- Selecting a country will toggle a pop-up containing real information about the country’s given environmental issue.
- Battle Mode:
(the aesthetics of this mode’s enemies and defending area will vary depending on environmental issue)
	- Player must defend the area and defeat the enemies by strategically placing Towers down on the battle grid
	- battle scene is laid out in a 6 x 4 grid with incoming enemies approaching right-to-left
 	- Upgrades Page: Upon completing a battle, the player can select a tower to upgrade, strengthening their effectiveness against enemies. This will provide player progression as they battle stronger enemies.

- Alignment: Player will be able to list ways that countries are combating environmental issues

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*
Overworld Actions: Player can move around the world freely using the arrow keys. To initiate a battle, they must approach a country emblem and press the spacebar -- this will place the player into the battle scene.

Battle Actions: Player can use numpad to highlight a given resource. You can select the box on the grid with the arrow keys, and spacebar locks in your placement. You must plan and place your resources strategically to protect the enemies from reaching the environment on the left hand side (enemies approach from right).

In the overworld, the player can also press the ‘P’ key to go into the pause menu. The player can navigate to different pages using the arrow and Enter keys.

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*
	Overworld
Player cannot enter a battle they have not unlocked yet (no collision)
Player enters battle when colliding with unlocked battle zone
Player cannot upgrade an object if they do not have enough resources 
Resources are gained through victorious battles
Battle Scene
Player cannot place a tower where one already stands
Player cannot place a tower if they do not have enough resources
Resources accumulate steadily over-time
Production of resources is accelerated by placing particular towers (i.e. windmill)
If an enemy makes it all the way to the left side of plane, damage to overall health is taken
When enough damage is taken, player loses battle and is sent back to overworld screen


# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*
	Overworld
There is the main player on the surface of the overworld
There are the emblems for each country which, when collided with, give you the option to engage in battle
Battle Scene
There are enemies that move from the right side to the left side
There are three types of resources that you can place on the battle grid:
Energy generating resources (speed up energy accumulation)
Attacking resources that shoot projectiles at enemies
Blockade resources that are temporary barriers
There is a hot bar with the list of accessible resources
There is an indicator on the selected grid box (used for placing)
There is an object on the lefthand side (that you must protect)
There is an overall health bar at the top of the screen


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Overworld Movement: The player is free to move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys within the confines of the world map. There are no boundaries other than the frame of the map.
- Battle Initiation: Each main country in the game (i.e. countries that you can battle) has an emblem in the middle of their boundary which indicated their issue (deforestation, air pollution, etc.). To initiate battle, the player can collide with an emblem. Players are not permitted to battle Boss enemies, which are indicated by emblems with locks, until they have progressed through a certain percentage of the game.
- Open Menu: Press ‘P’ key to open up the main menu in the overworld. You can open the menu anytime you are in the overworld.
Battle Mechanics
Select Tower: Use the numpad to select and move along the hotbar at the bottom of the screen. The selected resource will be highlighted when you press its button and you will have permission to place it on the battle grid.
Projectile Towers: This type of tower launches projectiles in the enemy’s direction. Projectile collisions deal damage to the enemy.
Energy Towers: This type of tower speeds up Energy regeneration, allowing the player to place more Towers at a faster pace.
Blockage Towers: This tower can be used as a temporary wall, blocking an enemy’s path when collided with.
Place Tower: use the arrow keys to select different sections of the grid. Press the spacebar key to place a tower in the selected section. A tower can only be placed if the player has enough resources for that particular tower and if there is not a tower in that location already
Enemy dealing damage: When enemy comes in contact with a tower, that tower takes damage until either of the two colliding run out of health. When enemy reaches the left side of plane which is being protected by the player, the players overall health is damaged
Progress and Upgrades: When a battle is one, your game progress percentage will go up, unlocking more enemies on the map. You will also be allowed to upgrade one Tower after each battle.
Upgrading: Upon winning a battle, the pop-up will be displayed to the player to allow upgrades on a tower for future endeavors. 
    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

After winning each battle, the defeated country’s appearance will change on the overworld -- going from gray and polluted to green and filled with trees. By the time you complete the game, the overworld will be restored.
There will be sound effects for each type of collision.
There will be a fanfare jingle when you defeat an enemy. :)

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

Overworld map will slowly become restored and cleared of objectives. This indicates that they are making progress against these issues
Menu will contain a progress bar 

# Story and Gameplay

The player wields the powers of conservation to save and restore the Earth from pollution. You must go from country to country and use your resources to fight against each environmental danger.

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*
Through an interactive tutorial, players will be shown how to do actions, and then must perform them themselves
Tutorial:
Player will be sent to the overworld map scene for a mock-up overworld with only one possible battle
Using pop-ups, the player will be shown how to move their character around using the arrow keys. 
Player will be shown how to display and navigate menu
The player will then be told to collide with the emblem to start a battle
Player will be sent to the battle scene
Pop-ups inform players how to move and select different sections of the grid. 
Players will be told how and asked to select different towers
Players will be be told how to place place towers and then asked to place one
Player will then be shown how different towers can be used
Player will be shown what happens when enemies collide with towers and how they can impact overall health
Enemy will begin to appear and player will have to use acquired knowledge to complete battle
Upon completion, player will be allowed to choose an upgrade for future battles


## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

By playing through battles against different countries’ environmental issues, players will begin to understand the measures needed to actually help the environment. With the varying types of issues being reflected aesthetically in the battle scenes of each country, players will also learn which countries struggle the most with specific types of environmental issues.

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*


## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*

Overworld map will look problematic and filled with issues to fix. This should give a sense of stress to the player and maybe even a sense of sudden realization to many problems Earth faces today. Player will look like a good-samaritan, hero type. In the battle scene, the left side which the player is protecting will be bright, natural, & happy. The right side which enemies come from should be dull and disgusting. Upon completing battles, overworld map will begin to look healthier as issues become resolved.

## Graphical

- Characters List (all character designs will use a 16-bit style)
  - Player: will have a retro style look, like the player in older Pokemon games
- Enemies: will consist of bulldozers, smog, and fireballs
- Tower: will consist of various looking trees, flowers, rocks, and energy resources (windmills, solar panels)

- Textures:
  - N/A
- Environment Art/Textures:
  - Overworld: Each country will look dark and dreary until you defeat them in battle, where they will then become green and healthy looking.
  - Battle Scene designs will look different depending on the country’s environmental issue
	- Deforestation: The enemies will appear as bulldozers, and the protected left-side will be filled with trees and animals
	- Air pollution: The enemies will appear as smog, and the protected side will be filled with homes and trees
	- Forest fires: The enemies will appear as fireballs and the protected side will be filled with trees and animals


## Audio


*Game region/phase/time are ways of designating a particularly important place in the game.*

- Music List (Ambient sound)
  - Overworld map: Retro pokemon style music will play
  - *Game region/phase/time*: *Example 3*, *Example 4*
  
*Game Interactions are things that trigger SFX, like character movement, hitting a spiky enemy, collecting a coin.*

- Sound List (SFX)
  - Enemy Collides with tower/base: bad crash sound
  - Tower attacks enemy: Positive hit sound
  - Select upgrade: coin sound from Mario
