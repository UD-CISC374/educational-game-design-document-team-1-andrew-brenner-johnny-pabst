## Elevator Pitch

*Learn about the dangers of invasive species by actually playing as one. Travel from host to host, infesting the natural landscape for the Spotted Lanternfly boss. Find sap spots to feed from the host plants and lay eggs to spread your horde.*

## Influences (Brief)
- Internship:
	- Medium: in-person experience
	- Explanation: While tracking and predicting movement of this invasive species, a great deal was learned about the harmful effects of this insect due to its recent and unprecedented arrival to the U.S.



## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

Scene 1 Mechanics (Flyover)
- Press arrow keys → move in that direction
- Collide with host plant → Enter scene two (attacking)
- Exit scene two with victory → that part of map becomes infested and trees become wilted
- All host plants have become infested and damaged → Victory, farmers display anger while Spotted Lanternflies rejoice

Scene 2 Mechanics (Attacking)
- Press arrow keys → move in that direction
- Player collides with sap spot → spotted lanternfly attaches in order to feed, new spotted lanternfly spawns and is now controlled by user, score increases, host plant health bar decreases, host plant overall image is wilted
- Player collides with Pray Mantis → Player is eaten and loses a life, new spotted lanternfly appears and is controllable by user
- Press spacebar → lay eggs in current spot IF in designated zone, score increases
- Pesticide warning overlay - a blinking overlay will appear on the screen in the area in which the pesticide will be sprayed, there is a slight delay after this before the pesticide is sprayed
- Spray of pesticide collides with player → player loses life, new spotted lanternfly appears and is now controlled by user
- Reach end of tree → sent back to scene 1 (Flyover)
- Player collides with other spotted lanternflies → Player stops moving and cannot pass through object
 Player can fall out of bounds of bottom of the screen → player will lose a life, respawn as new spotted lanternfly

# What sets this project apart?
- Spotted Lanternflies are an extremely relevant and fairly new issue in local areas (East coast)
- Spotted Lanternflies are a problem in other parts of the world as well, mainly Asia
- Based on real-world issues
- Represents a “day-in-the-life” of a Spotted Lanternfly
- The player gets to watch the tree become more and more damaged as more Spotted Lanternflys begin to feed on it and lay eggs 


# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern
This is a game for one person, the player will control a Spotted Lanternfly as it flies over an area filled with fruit-trees and vineyards. Upon colliding with one of these spots in the area, the player will be placed directly onto the tree or vine, moving up and infesting it with more and more Spotted Lanternflies by feeding on it and laying eggs, all while avoiding roaming praying mantises and sprays of pesticides. This continues until all host plants in the area are infested and damaged.

## Player Modes
- Single-player
	- Repetitively infest areas until all possible host plants are infested and damaged


# Gameplay Objectives
- Infest all host plants in the area:
	- Description: Progress through the game completing each level and effectively infesting each host plant and damaging it
	- Alignment: Players will learn the various types of host plants which Spotted Lanternflies target such as fruit trees and vineyards
- Complete level (infest the host tree):
 	- Description: Place enough spotted lanternflies on the host plant to feed upon it and lay eggs which effectively damage the host plant
 	- Alignment: Gives a visible example of how these insects are damaging these host plants and how it correlates to their health
- Avoid Pray Mantises and sprays of pesticide
	- Description: While feeding on the host plant and laying eggs, the player must avoid roaming pray mantises, spray of pesticide in order to survive 
	- Alignment: Informs the player that there is a way of defeating these bugs and that humans do not enjoy their presence. Although they are not natural predators, Pray mantises seem to be one of the only things that are currently willing to eat Spotted Lanternflies
- Feed and lay eggs on host plant
	- Description: While avoiding pray mantises and sprays of pesticide, the player must place enough eggs and other Spotted Lanternflies on the tree to feed on it until it is severely damaged
	- Alignment: This shows the user what the Spotted Lanterfly is doing in order to damage the tree and that the health of the host plant directly correlates to the Spotted Lanternflies feeding on it.

# Procedures/Actions
- Scene 1 (Flyover) Actions: Player moves around the area using arrow keys to visit different host plants in order to infest them by moving to scene 2 (attacking). Complete each level around the area, damaging each host plant to cause maximum damage to the humans.

- Scene 2 (Attacking) Actions: Player moves around the host plant using the arrow keys to find spots for feeding and laying eggs. Simultaneously, players must avoid roaming praying mantises and sprays of pesticides. Continue infesting the host plant until it is overtaken and damaged


# Rules
- While in Scene 1 (Flyover):
	- Must collide with host plant to initiate next scene
	- Player wins game by destroying all available host plants
	- Player can only infest one host plant at a time
- While in Scene 2 (Attacking):
	- Player must stay on the surface of the host plant
	- If player collides with Pray Mantis, the player loses a life
	- If player is hit with pesticide, the player loses a life
	- If player falls out of bounds on bottom of screen, the player loses a life
	- Reach the end of the tree to finish
	- Can only feed on designated sap spots
	- Can only lay eggs in designated spots 
	- Player cannot pass through other spotted lanternflies


# Objects/Entities
Scene 1 (Flyover):
- Main Spotted Lanternfly controlled by user
- Spotted Lanternfly followers
- Human farmer

Scene 2 (Attacking):
- Spotted Lanternfly controlled by user
- Pesticide spray
- Pray Mantises
- Sap Spots
- Eggs laid by Spotted Lanternflies
- Health bar for tree
- Small image reflecting the tree as a whole



## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
Scene 1 (Flyover):
- Movement: Use the arrow keys to move the Spotted Lanternfly around the area
	- Collision: Collide with a host plant to begin infesting it in scene 2 (attacking)
	- Victory: Infest and damage all host plants in the area to obtain victory. Human farmers will display anger and talk about the damages while your army of Spotted Lanternflies rejoice and celebrate
Scene 2 (Attacking):
- Player collides with Pray Mantis: Player is eaten and loses a life. Player respawns as a new Spotted Lanternfly
- Pesticide appearance: a red blinking overlay will appear on the screen in the area in which the pesticide will be sprayed, there will be a slight delay before the harmful pesticide is sprayed
- Player collides with pesticide spray: Player loses a life and respawns as a new Spotted Lanternfly
- Player collides with sap spot: That Spotted Lanternfly latches on to that point and begins feeding. The player then respawns as a new Spotted Lanternfly to continue infesting the host plant
- Player presses spacebar: IF the player is in one of the designated spots, the user controlled Spotted Lanternfly will lay eggs. As a result, the player’s score will increase
- Collision with Obstacle: If the player collides with another spotted lanternfly obstacle, the user cannot pass through the object. They “stay” in the same place as the camera continues to move up
- Out of Bounds: If the Player falls out of bounds leads to them losing a life. They then respawn as a new Spotted Lanterfly


## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*
- Feeding on the host plant causes the health bar to decrease and the image of the overall plant to becomes wilted
- Completing a level is reflected visually by making the host plants in that area, in scene 1 (flyover), appear wilted
- positive audio feedback when feeding on sap/laying eggs/completing levels
- negative feedback when getting eaten by praying mantis, killed from pesticide, falling out of bounds






*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*
- The Overworld map will slowly become wilted and infested as you beat levels.


# Story and Gameplay
You play as a swarm of Spotted Lanternflies looking to find their next area to infest. The introduction will personify the swarm as a crime gang, with 	the head Spotted Lanternfly acting as the mafioso. The boss lanternfly will teach you the rules of the game in the tutorial, and you will then be free to infest the rest of the area. Your goal is to help the boss lead his crew to completely invade every host tree in the area.

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

The player will begin in a tutorial stage. Beginning in scene 1 (flyover), the user will have one host plant on the map to collide with. Through a brief dialogue with the boss Spotted Lanterfly character, the user will be instructed interactively how to move and where to move to. Upon collision with a host plant, the user will be sent to scene 2 (attacking), and begin a mock-up version. The boss will still be conversing with the user, pointing out what to avoid, where to feed and lay eggs. The boss will also point out that the host plant is being damaged and wilted as it is fed upon. These conversations will avoid long text and use simple language while utilizing indicators to highlight objects.



## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

A brief dialogue between you as a Spotted Lanternfly, your boss, and a human farmer will inform you on your mission as an invasive species. NOTE: the “mafia boss” element is in the introduction and tutorial only, and will not carry over to the more realistic gameplay. This will emphasize to the player that you are actually playing on the bad guy’s team in this game, underlining the negative effects of invasive species. The overall appearance of each of the host plants will be negatively affected and look wilted. Moreso, while feeding on a host plant, the host plant’s health bar will decrease and the image of the host plant will appear more wilted as the player progresses.

## Story (Brief)

You control a horde of Spotted Lanternflies, an invasive species of bugs harming agriculture and trees on the East Coast. It is your duty, with the help of the mob boss lanternfly, to infest local farms and spread your species to every host tree around.


## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

Storyboard images can be found in our repo: https://github.com/UD-CISC374/educational-game-design-document-team-1-andrew-brenner-johnny-pabst


# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
- The crime-based storyline will portray the player as a criminal helping damage the local landscape. The dialogue from the crime boss will be humorous to appeal to the younger audience, but his evil spirit & encouragement of the destruction will reinforce that you are playing for the villan.
- The music and tempo of the host tree levels will be frantic (Flight of the Bumblee) as the horde of Spotted Lanternflies takes over.
- As you beat levels and infest host plants, the area will start to look dull and decayed, giving the player a sense of guilt as they progress and damage the host plants.
