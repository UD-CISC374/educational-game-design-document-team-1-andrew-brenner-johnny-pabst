## Influences (Brief)

- Plants vs. Zombies:
  - Medium: Video Game
  - Explanation: Our core battle mechanic is heavily influenced by the Plants vs. Zombies' tower defense style
- Pokemon/Final Fantasy:
  - Medium: Video Game
  - Explanation: Our overworld and transition to battle scenes is based on the classic RPG mechanics found in games like Pokemon and Final Fantasy. Our stats page is inspired by Pokemon’s Pokedex mechanic. 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Scene 1 Mechanics (Overworld)
  - Move up/down/left/right on map using arrow keys
  - Collide into country badges to initiate battles
  - Open menu using the ‘P’ key
- Overworld Menu
  - Use arrows to move up and down list of countries
- Scene 2 Mechanics (Battle Scene)
  - Use num pad to select available tower in the inventory bar
  - use arrow keys to move on grid-layout (where to place tower)
  - space bar to place tower on grid-layout
  - enemy moves right to left on plane
  - enemy collides with left “base” → overall health is damaged
  - enemy collides with “tower” → damages tower health
  - User plant/tower attacks enemy -> enemy takes damage (various types of plants with different attacks, ranges)

- Player’s can get a sense of accomplishment from combating real-world environmental issues
- Learning objects will inform the user on methods of dealing with current environmental issues
- The player obtains a sense of progress by defeating pressing issues and cleaning up the earth. The player will visibly see on the map that each region is becoming healthier as they progress.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern
This is a game for one person, they control the player in the overworld region to region with the arrow keys. When battles are initiated they use and place Towers with the number pad, arrow keys, and spacebar. Defend the area and defeat the enemy. Continue conquering the overworld through battles until every issue is resolved.

## Player Modes
- Title Screen: Title with start button which initiates the tutorial
- Tutorial Mode: Player is dropped into the overworld area where they will be greeted by a monkey character. The monkey will explain the dangers that deforestation is causing and explain the overall goal of the game (stopping the bulldozers, raising awareness, etc.).
 - EXAMPLE DIALOGUE: “Hey! Finally a human is on our side! We need you to raise awareness in order to save our homes. By raising enough support, you can influence countries to pass laws to help save the trees!”
 - Then, pop-up messages (from the monkey) will begin teaching the player how to move and interact with the world. There is then a transition to a tutorial battle sequence which explains the battle mechanics. The player is then free to roam the overworld freely.
- Overworld: World map with overlay badges corresponding to a country’s environmental issue. The player may initiate a battle scene when colliding with a badge pinned on the map.
- Overworld Menu: Can only be accessed in the overworld. 
- Stats Pages: Displays a general progress bar and a list of all in-game countries.
  - A country can be in one of three modes: locked, unresolved, and resolved.
    - locked countries will display required progress needed to battle
  - Selecting a country will toggle a pop-up containing real information about the country’s given environmental issue.
- Battle Mode:
  - Player must defend the area and defeat the enemies by strategically placing Towers down on the battle grid
  - battle scene is laid out in a 6 x 4 grid with incoming enemies approaching right-to-left
- Upgrades Pop-up: Upon completing a battle, the player can select a tower to upgrade, strengthening their effectiveness against enemies. This will provide player progression as they battle stronger enemies.



# Gameplay Objectives
- Clear the Overworld Map:
  - Description: Progress through the game by completing objectives in each region one-by-one
  - Alignment: Player will be able to identify which countries are facing deforestation issues
- Complete level:
  - Description: Defeat all approaching enemies when in battle 
  - Alignment: Player will be able to list ways that countries are combating environmental issues and they will also be able to compare severity of environmental issues between countries (based on level and difficulty of a given country’s battle sequence)
- Upgrade Resources
  - Description: Power-up resources to become more effective in battle
  - Alignment: Player will be able to list ways that countries are combating environmental issues

# Procedures/Actions
- Overworld Actions: Player can move around the world freely using the arrow keys. To initiate a battle, they must collide with a country emblem -- this will place the player into the battle scene. In the overworld, the player can also press the ‘P’ key to go into the pause menu. The player can navigate the list of countries using the arrow keys.
- Battle Actions: Player can use numpad to highlight a given resource. You can select the box on the grid with the arrow keys, and spacebar locks in your placement. You must plan and place your resources strategically to protect the enemies from reaching the base on the left hand side (enemies approach from right).

# Rules
- While in Overworld:
  - Player cannot enter a battle they have not unlocked yet (no collision)
  - Player enters battle when colliding with unlocked battle zone (badge over country)
- While in Battle Scene:
  - Player cannot place a tower where one already stands
  - Player cannot place a tower if they do not have enough resources
  - Resources accumulate steadily over-time
  - Production of resources is accelerated by placing particular towers (i.e. windmill)
  - If an enemy makes it all the way to the left side of plane, damage to overall health is taken
    - When enough damage is taken, player loses battle and is sent back to overworld screen
  - Player can only upgrade one tower at a time
    - This can only be done after a victorious battle


# Objects/Entities
- Overworld:
  - There is the main player on the surface of the overworld
  - There are the emblems for each country which, when collided with, give you the option to engage in battle
    - Three types of emblems
      - Locked
        - Battle is currently unavailable, player must progress further to unlock
        - Emblem is at low opacity

      - Animated windmills and solar panels
    - Attacking Towers that shoot projectiles at enemies
      - Animated Trees and plants projecting seeds at enemies
    - Blockade Towers that are temporary barriers
      - May or may not damage the enemy upon impact
      - Animated thorn bushes or piles of rocks
  - There is a hot bar with the list of accessible towers

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
Overworld Mechanics:
- Overworld Movement: The player is free to move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys within the confines of the world map. There are no boundaries other than the frame of the map.
- Battle Initiation: Each main country in the game (i.e. countries that you can battle) has an emblem in the middle of their boundary which indicates that they have an issue regarding deforestation. To initiate battle, the player can collide with an emblem. Players are not permitted to battle Boss enemies, which are indicated by emblems with locks, until they have progressed through a certain percentage of the game.
- Open Menu: Press ‘P’ key to open up the main menu in the overworld. You can open the menu anytime you are in the overworld.
- Navigate menu: Using the arrow keys, you can move up and down the list of countries. Each country will have a status: locked, resolved, or unresolved. If locked, the user will see how much progress they need to unlock the area. If resolved or unresolved, the country will display a fact regarding deforestation.

Battle Mechanics:
- Select Tower: Use the numpad to select and move along the hotbar at the bottom of the screen. The selected resource will be highlighted when you press its button and you will have permission to place it on the battle grid.
- Projectile Towers: This type of tower launches projectiles in the enemy’s direction. Projectile collisions deal damage to the enemy.
- Energy Towers: This type of tower speeds up Energy regeneration, allowing the player to place more Towers at a faster pace.
- Blockage Towers: This tower can be used as a temporary wall, blocking or slowing an enemy’s path when collided with. May or may not damage enemy health upon impact depending on which blockage tower is selected
- Place Tower: use the arrow keys to select different sections of the grid. Press the spacebar key to place a tower in the selected section. A tower can only be placed if the player has enough resources for that particular tower and if there is not a tower in that location already
- Enemy dealing damage: The enemy moves right to left. When an enemy comes in contact with a tower, that tower takes damage until either of the two colliding run out of health. When enemy reaches the left side of plane, which is being protected by the player, the player’s overall health is damaged
- Upgrading: Upon winning a battle, a pop-up will be displayed to the player to allow upgrades on a tower for future endeavors. 
    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

- After winning each battle, the defeated country’s appearance will change on the overworld -- that region will go from displaying trees under distress, perhaps under attack, to being filled with green happy trees. By the time you complete the game, the overworld will be restored.
- There will be sound effects for each type of collision.
  - Grunts and motor sounds for approaching enemies
  - Axe chopping sounds for lumberjacks when attacking
  - Power-up sound when producing green energy
  - Pleasant / fun hit sound when plants project seeds at enemies
  - There will be a fanfare jingle when you defeat an enemy.

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

- The Overworld map will slowly become restored and cleared of objectives. This indicates that they are making progress against these issues and that the world seems to be a much happier place
- Menu will contain a progress bar

# Story and Gameplay


## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

- Through an interactive tutorial, players will be shown how to do actions, and then must perform them themselves
Tutorial:
1. Player will be sent to the overworld map scene for a mock-up overworld with only one possible battle
2. Using pop-ups, the player will be shown how to move their character around using the arrow keys. 
3. Player will be shown how to display and navigate menu
4. The player will then be told to collide with the emblem to start a battle
5. Player will be sent to the battle scene
6. Pop-ups inform players how to move and select different sections of the grid. 
7. Players will be told how and asked to select different towers
8. Players will be be told how to place place towers and then asked to place one
9. Player will then be shown how different towers can be used
10. Player will be shown what happens when enemies collide with towers and how they can impact overall health
11. Enemy will begin to appear and player will have to use acquired knowledge to complete battle
12. Upon completion, player will be allowed to choose an upgrade for future battles


## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

- By playing through battles against different countries’ environmental issues, players will begin to understand the measures needed to actually help the environment such as green energy. By traveling region to region, the player will learn which countries are currently dealing with a deforestation crisis.

## Story (Brief)

- The player wields the powers of conservation to save and restore the Earth from deforestation. You must go from region to region and use your resources to save the trees in each location against destructive forces

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

Storyboard images can be found in our repo: https://github.com/UD-CISC374/educational-game-design-document-team-1-andrew-brenner-johnny-pabst


# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*

- Overworld map will look problematic and filled with issues to fix. This should give a sense of stress to the player and maybe even a sense of sudden realization to many problems Earth faces today. Player will look like a good-samaritan, hero type. In the battle scene, the left side which the player is protecting will be bright, natural, & happy. The right side which enemies come from should be dull and obscure, perhaps just a thick layer of smog. Upon completing battles, the overworld map will begin to look healthier as issues become resolved. Unresolved emblems will be replaced with green happy trees.

## Graphical
