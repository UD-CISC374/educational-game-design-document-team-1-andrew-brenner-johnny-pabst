## Elevator Pitch

Travel the world region to region where your help is most needed, battling against destructive forces in an effort to stop deforestation. Lay down your defenses in order to protect the environment against the enemy in this tower defense style strategy game. 

## Influences (Brief)
- Pong
	- Medium: Video Game
	- Explanation: Mechanics heavily influences, i.e. moving up and down to prevent an approaching object from colliding with the left side of screen.
- Pokemon/Final Fantasy:
	- Medium: Video Game
	- Explanation: Our overworld and transition to battle scenes is based on the classic RPG mechanics found in games like Pokemon and Final Fantasy. Our stats page is inspired by Pokemon’s Pokedex mechanic. 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Scene 1 Mechanics (Overworld)
	- Move up/down/left/right on map using arrow keys
	- Collide into country badges to initiate battle pop-up
	- Press spacebar key to confirm 
	- Open menu using the ‘P’ key
- Overworld Menu
	- Use arrows to move up and down list of countries
- Scene 2 Mechanics (Protest Scene)
	- Defense Mode: use arrow keys to move protester up and down to block bulldozers
	- Use arrow keys to move left and right one block to change from defense mode to plant mode
	- Plant Mode: Press space bar repetitively to replant and water tree
	- enemy moves right to left on plane
	- enemy collides with player in defense mode → enemy disappears
	- enemy collides with tree → tree is destroyed and player loses a “life”, enemy disappears
	- Tree becomes fully grown → player gains a “life”
	- There is a round timer that may vary between rounds

# What sets this project apart?
- The learning objectives will be achieved by in-game visual and gameplay cues reinforced by reading small informational pieces.
- Player’s can get a sense of accomplishment from combating real-world environmental issues
- Player raises awareness around the world on real-world issues
- Learning objects will inform the user on methods of dealing with current environmental issues
- The player obtains a sense of progress by defeating pressing issues and defending the earth. The player will visibly see on the map that each region is becoming healthier as they progress.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern
This is a game for one person, they control the player in the overworld traveling region to region with the arrow keys. When a protest is initiated, the player must move up and down to block incoming bulldozers from destroying trees. The player can replant destroyed trees, but may risk trees currently standing. Defend the area and defeat the enemy. Continue protesting around the world until every issue is resolved.

## Player Modes
- Title Screen: Title with start button which initiates the tutorial
- Tutorial Mode: Player is dropped into the overworld area where they will be greeted by a monkey character. The monkey will explain the dangers that deforestation is causing and explain the overall goal of the game (stopping the bulldozers, raising awareness, etc.).
	- EXAMPLE DIALOGUE: “Hey! Finally a human is on our side! We need you to raise awareness in order to save our homes. By raising enough support, you can influence countries to pass laws to help save the trees!”
	- Then, pop-up messages (from the monkey) will begin teaching the player how to move and interact with the world. There is then a transition to a tutorial protest sequence which explains the battle mechanics. The player is then free to roam the overworld freely.
- Overworld: World map with overlay badges corresponding to a country’s environmental issue. The player may initiate a battle scene when colliding with a badge pinned on the map and pressing the spacebar key when prompted.
- Overworld Menu: Can only be accessed in the overworld. 
	- Stats Pages: Displays the current number of supporters and a list of all in-game countries.
		- A country can be in one of three modes: locked, unresolved, and resolved.
			- locked countries will display the required number of supporters needed to battle
		- Selecting a country will toggle a pop-up containing real information about the country’s given environmental issue.
- Protest Mode:
	- Player must defend the area by moving up and down to prevent incoming enemy bulldozers from colliding with trees
	- Player must meet the required number of trees left standing by the end of round


# Gameplay Objectives
- Clear the Overworld Map:
	- Description: Progress through the game by completing objectives in each region one-by-one resulting in a raise of awareness
	- Alignment: The player will be able to identify which countries are facing deforestation issues. Also, the player will see that much support is needed in order to change policy and pass laws
- Complete level:
	- Description: Prevent enemies from destroying trees, keep a certain number of trees standing by the end of timer 
	- Alignment: The player will be able to categorize protesting and replanting as crucial methods in fighting deforestation and be able to compare severity of environmental issues between countries (based on level and difficulty of a given country’s battle sequence). 
- Upgrade Player
	- Description: By gaining more supporters through victorious protests, another protester may be added to the protest scene to help defend
	- Alignment: Protest efforts become strengthened as support and awareness for the issue grows.

# Procedures/Actions
- Overworld Actions: Player can move around the world freely using the arrow keys. To initiate a battle, they must collide with a country emblem and confirm with spacebar -- this will place the player into the battle scene. In the overworld, the player can also press the ‘P’ key to go into the pause menu. The player can navigate the list of countries using the arrow keys.

- Protest Actions: Player must use arrow keys to move up and down to prevent incoming enemies on the right from colliding with trees on the left side. The player can move into the “green zone” in order to plant a tree. Player must repetitively hit the spacebar key to grow the tree. However, players cannot block incoming bulldozers while in the “green zone.” The player must hop out of “green zone” and into defend mode to continue blocking enemies.

# Rules
While in Overworld:
- Player cannot enter a battle they have not unlocked yet (no collision)
- Levels are unlocked by gaining the required number of supporters

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
Overworld Mechanics:
- Overworld Movement: The player is free to move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys within the confines of the world map. There are no boundaries other than the frame of the map.
- Battle Initiation: Each main country in the game (i.e. countries that you can battle) has an emblem in the middle of their boundary which indicates that they have an issue regarding deforestation. To initiate battle, the player can collide with an emblem and press spacebar to confirm. Players are not permitted to play “Boss” levels, which are indicated by emblems with locks, until they have raised enough awareness and gained enough supporters by progressing through the game.
- Open Menu: Press ‘P’ key to open up the main menu in the overworld. You can open the menu anytime you are in the overworld.
- Navigate menu: Using the arrow keys, you can move up and down the list of countries. Each country will have a status: locked, resolved, or unresolved. If locked, the user will see how much progress they need to unlock the area. If resolved or unresolved, the country will display a fact regarding deforestation.
Protest Mechanics:
- Movement: Use arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.
Crossing the line: Move left and right to move from defend mode to the “green zone.” This changes the players abilities
- Blocking: Move up and down into an enemies path to collide with them. Collision between player and enemy results in the enemy disappearing
- Destroy Tree: When an enemy collides with a tree, that tree is destroyed and replaced with a stump. If the tree was fully grown, the player loses a “life.” Enemy disappears
- Plant / grow tree: While in the green zone, player can press spacebar reptively to plant and grow a tree
- Tree becomes fully grown: player gains a “life”


## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

- After winning each battle, the defeated country’s appearance will change on the overworld -- that region will go from displaying trees under distress, perhaps under attack, to being filled with green happy trees. By the time you complete the game, the overworld will be restored.
- There will be sound effects for each type of collision.
	- Axe chopping sounds for lumberjacks when attacking
	- Fun / pleasant sound when player collides with enemy
- Grunts and motor sounds for approaching enemies
- There will be a fanfare jingle when you defeat an enemy.

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

- The Overworld map will slowly become restored and cleared of objectives. This indicates that they are making progress against these issues and that the world seems to be a much happier place
- Menu will display the current number of supporters
	- This will increase as they progress through the game and are victorious in their protests

# Story and Gameplay


## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

Through an interactive tutorial, players will be shown how to do actions, and then must perform them themselves
Tutorial:

1. Player will be sent to the overworld map scene for a mock-up overworld with only one possible Protest
2. Orangutan guide will show player why he needs their help and how they may be able to help by raising awareness and support through protests around the world
3. Player will be shown in an interactive way how to move and interact with the world including the menus
4. The player will then be guided through a mock-up protest while still being guided by the wise orangutan

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

By playing through protests against different countries, players will begin to understand the measures needed to actually help the environment such as planting trees, protesting, and change in policy. By traveling region to region, the player will learn which countries are currently dealing with a deforestation crisis and to what severity. Through victorious protests, the player will see the number of supporters for the cause grow, which will help them tackle more serious issues.

## Story (Brief)

The player is greeted by a wise orangutan who enlists him/her to help fight deforestation around the world. You must go from region to region and utilize protesting and replanting to save the trees against destructive forces. As you progress through the game, you gather support and more protesters to help bring change in policy in order to save the trees.

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

Storyboard images can be found in our repo: https://github.com/UD-CISC374/educational-game-design-document-team-1-andrew-brenner-johnny-pabst


# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*

Overworld map will look problematic and filled with issues to fix. This should give a sense of stress to the player and maybe even a sense of sudden realization to many problems Earth faces today. Player will look like a good-samaritan, hero type. In the battle scene, the left side which the player is protecting will be filled with trees and should look bright, natural, & happy. The “green zone” containing the trees will have a green overlay giving it a healthy appearance. The ground outside of this area will be a barren dirt field. Through victorious protests, the overworld map will begin to look healthier as issues become resolved and the number of supporters will grow giving a sense of accomplishment. Unresolved emblems will be replaced with green happy trees.
